# What We Can Do For You...

Once
we have assessed your ability, you will be offered a place with SSU. You will then
have an online portfolio created, which can be accessed by all our American
coaches. Depending upon your ability athletically and academically, we can
begin targeting the colleges that best fit YOU. 

_Then it will be your chance
to shine!_

You will be invited to attend one of our showcase games, where we
will have our US coaches in attendance. After your successful showcase we will
assist you in receiving the best scholarship package.

We
will walk you through every step of the way from registering for your SATs to
obtaining medical insurance. To get you ready for the United States we will
issue you with a FREE strength and conditioning programme. The opportunity to
head Stateside will improve you as a player, person and more importantly will
enhance your future with a Bachelor's Degree. Simply fill out our free
evaluation form today to get the process started!
